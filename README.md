# data-driven-astronomy
Data-driven Astronomy course repository

## Description
This repository contains algorithmic solutions that were implemented in the context of the course [**Data-driven Astronomy**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-driven-astronomy) which is provided by the [**University of Sydney**](https://www.sydney.edu.au/) on Coursera.

## About the course
The course investigates challenges that arise when working with large astronomy datasets:
- How to implement algorithms that work
- How to use databases to manage data
- How to learn from data with machine learning

### Course outline
The course comprises of different themes/entities split over weeks:
- **Week 1: Thinking about data**
  - Principles of computational thinking
  - Discovering pulsars in radio images
- **Week 2: Big data makes things slow**
  - How to work out the time complexity of algorithms
  - Exploring the black holes at the centres of massive galaxies
- **Week 3: Querying data using SQL**
  - How to use databases to analyse your data
  - Investigating exoplanets in other solar systems
- **Week 4: Managing your data**
  - How to set up databases to manage your data
  - Exploring the lifecycle of stars in our Galaxy
- **Week 5: Learning from data: regression**
  - Using machine learning tools to investigate your data
  - Calculating the redshifts of distant galaxies
- **Week 6: Learning from data: classification**
  - Using machine learning tools to classify your data
